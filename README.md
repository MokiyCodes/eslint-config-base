# ESLint-Config-Base

Welcome to `@norathefurry/eslint-config-base`, the home of my personal "base" ESLint config's plain JS rules - No plugins, just ESLint.

[`@norathefurry/eslint-config`](https://npm.im/@norathefurry/eslint-config) ([Source](https://github.com/MokiyCodes/eslint-config)) is what I use for most projects.

## Usage

Step 1: Run `pnpm i -D @norathefurry/eslint-config-base`<br/>
Step 2: Save the [Preset Config](https://github.com/MokiyCodes/eslint-config-preset/blob/main/.eslintrc.js) to your project's `.eslintrc.js` (replace `@norathefurry/eslint-config` with `@norathefurry/eslint-config-base`)<br/>
Step 3: Done!
